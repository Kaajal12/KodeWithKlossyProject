Kode with Klossy Final Project (Mobile App Development - 2022)

Pawsibilities, an app designed to help educate pet owners on their pet's daily nutrition, hopes to make a positive change on a cat's or dog's lifestyle. 
According to the data entered by the user, an exact measurement (given in cups) of dry food is recommended per serving. Our product serves as a purpose to 
provide pet owners with an accurate measurement of food measurements to be given for the pet's daily diet. 

Additionally, on the fun facts page users can generate a random fun fact each time the button is clicked. My team and I designed our app by including a 
launch screen, a scroll view, an image viewer to allow the user to select a photo from their gallery, multiple pages that are connected with segues, and a 
segmented control. Our multiple pages includes a Create Pet Profile, About Us, and Fun Facts.

Furthermore, our minimum viable product mobile application was created in XCode using Swift.
